GeoPoint represents a geographic point for Node.js and the browser, and provides distance between points and radius bounding box calculations.

## Usage

```javascript
import GeoPoint from 'geopoint';

const statueOfLiberty = new GeoPoint(40.689604, -74.04455);
```

### Constructor options

* `latitude`
* `longitude`
* `inRadians`: `true` if the latitude and longitude are in radians, defaults to `false`.

### Methods

* `latitude(inRadians)`: return the point's latitude. By default, the latitude is in degrees, unless `inRadians` is `true`.
* `longitude(inRadians)`: return the point's longitude. By default, the longitude is in degrees, unless `inRadians` is `true`.
* `distanceTo(point, inKilometers)`: calculate the distance to another `GeoPoint` instance. By default, the distance is calculated in miles, unless `inKilometers` is `true`.
* `boundingCoordinates(distance, radius, inKilometers)`: calculates the bounding coordinates of `distance` from the point and returns an array with the SW and NE points of the bounding box. If `radius` is not provided, the radius of the Earth will be used. The distance is calculated in miles unless `inKilometers` is `true`.

### Static methods

* `GeoPoint.degreesToRadians(value)`: converts `value` in degrees to radians.
* `GeoPoint.radiansToDegrees(value)`: converts `value` in radians to degrees.
* `GeoPoint.milesToKilometers(value)`: converts `value` in miles to kilometers.
* `GeoPoint.kilometersToMiles(value)`: converts `value` in kilometers to miles.
